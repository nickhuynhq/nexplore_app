# Nexplore

**ðŸ§­ Nexplore is a mobile application where users can search and find local hotel, restaurants, and attractions within a particular area**

- This project was created using React Native <br>
- In addition, **Tailwind CSS** allowed me to flex my styling muscles, using new components to create the sleek UI.<br>
- Entire application was built on TypeScript <br>
- Location information was pulled from the Travel Advisor API <br>
